# Tumbledown Tavern - A Python Terminal Game Collection

Welcome to the Tumbledown Tavern! This is a simple yet engaging text-based game suite written in Python. It's a classic console application that serves as a great example of fundamental programming concepts like loops, conditional logic, and user input, all wrapped in a fun, thematic package.

## Features

## How to Play

### 1. War of the Hand

A classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

* **Rock (1)** crushes Scissors.
* **Paper (2)** covers Rock.
* **Scissors (3)** cuts Paper.

### 2. The Number Sieve

A number-guessing game.

* You choose the maximum number for the range.
* The tavern keeper thinks of a secret number.
* Guess the number! Each correct guess earns a point, but each wrong guess costs you one.

### 3. Trial by Seven

A dice game of chance.

* Place a wager from your balance.
* Bet on whether the sum of two dice will be:
    * **Below 7 (1)**
    * **Above 7 (2)**
    * **Exactly 7 (3)**
* Winning on "Below 7" or "Above 7" doubles your bet. A "Lucky 7" pays out at 4-to-1!
